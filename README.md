Dear Vlatko,

I have completed the assigned tasks and reaching out to provide an update before the time runs out.

The first two tasks were fully completed. Then I added an API to expose the Bookmarks. While I was able to generate a JWT token successfully, I am facing an issue during the validation process.  I consistently get a 401 error. So, I need a further investigation to resolve this matter. Despite this challenge, I am confident that I have adhered to the correct steps and structure outlined in the project so far.

Feel free to run the project at your convenience, and if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Additionally, please execute the <b>update-database</b> command first, as modifications were made to the structure.

I appreciate your understanding and look forward to hearing back from you.

Regards,<br>
Samitha
