Update 17/02/2024 

I was able to fix the issue with token validation. It was due to a mismatch between the issuer and the audience. I figured it out after adding logs to my authentication. Now <b>api/bookmarks/getbookmarks</b> call successfully returns the bookmarks for an authenticated user.

Dear Vlatko,

I have completed the assigned tasks and would like to give you an update before the time runs out.

The first two tasks were fully completed. Then I added an API to expose the Bookmarks. While I was able to generate a JWT token successfully, I am facing an issue during the validation process.  I consistently get a 401 error. So, I would need to do some more investigation to resolve this matter. Despite this challenge, I am confident that I have followed the correct steps and structure outlined in the project.

Feel free to run the project at your convenience, and if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Additionally, please execute the <b>update-database</b> command first, as modifications were made to the structure.

I appreciate your understanding and look forward to hearing back from you.

Regards,<br>
Samitha
